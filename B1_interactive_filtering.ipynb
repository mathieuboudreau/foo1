Even if B<sub>1</sub> is calibrated to a high degree of homogeneity in an empty scanner (e.g. using pickup coils and RF transmit coil design optimization), electrodynamic interactions with tissues (loading/boundaries) will distort the B<sub>1</sub> amplitude profile [6]. <br/><br/>\n",
    "        The general idea behind B<sub>1</sub> mapping is to determine a pulse sequence that varies with respect to the B<sub>1</sub> field and only the B<sub>1</sub> field. MR image signal intensity depends on many variables, a single acquisition is not enough to uniquely quantify the B<sub>1</sub> field. Therefore, at least two images are usually acquired and a mathematical operation is used to cancel out all other undesired characteristics in the image [7]. <br/><br/>\n",

    "        One of the simplest ways to map B1 in vivo is to acquire two otherwise identical images using different excitation flip angles. The actual voxel-wise flip angles can be then estimated with simple trigonometry, by calculating the ratio in expected signal amplitudes. This is called the Double Angle Method (DA method). Using the Double Angle (DA) method, one image is acquired with double the excitation flip angle than the other, which results in a very simple equation for a spin-echo acquisition pulse sequence demonstrated in the equation ($\\ref{eq:1}$).\n",

The library is suitable for creating applications that provide an adjustable layout of data visualization, making it perfect for use by anyone using Python to work with data. With the help of a few simple templates, Dash manages to abstract all the technologies and protocols that exist or occur in the background and are needed to build an interactive web application [3].<br/>\n",

The <code>dash_core_components</code> describe higher-level components that are interactive and are generated with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS through the React.js library. In this project the tree of components is composed of html's <code>h1</code>, <code>h3</code>, <code>div</code>, <code>p</code> and dcc's <code>Graph</code> components.\n",

The \"inputs\" and \"outputs\" of the application interface in Dash are described declaratively through the <code>app.callback</code> decorator. In Dash, the inputs and outputs of the application are simply the properties of a particular component [3]. In this notebook's dashboard, the inputs are the dropdown components(each with different id) and the outputs are the graph components <code>map_raw</code> and <code>map_filtered</code>. Whenever an input property changes in the dropdown components, the function that the callback decorator wrap will get called automatically and the output graphs will be updated.\n",

    "        This notebook used many features of the Jupyter eco-system to demonstrate the vast scope of possibilities that this open-source community enables to researchers, scientists, students and everyone else in need of integrating live code, data visualization, equations and narration that can be easily shared and reproduced.<br/><br/>\n",
    "        The topic of this notebook also briefly talks about an area that is of interest to quantitative MRI and is considered to contain valuable information about the precision and details of MRI images and imaging techniques. The usage of the Jupyter Notebook together with the Script of Scripts makes it convenient to execute code written for MATLAB/Octave by a third party source and afterwards use these results together with modern visualization frameworks for Python to create an interactive dashboard where the user can see the differences of applying different input parameters to a certain output. In the case of the project, code cells were used to generate maps by using B<sub>1</sub> double angle method and filter those maps and afterwards display the maps in an interactive dashboard where the user is able to clearly see the difference in the images when applying different filter types and filters of different orders. In addition to this, the cells written in Markdown serve as great guides to anyone who is interested in what the notebook does and what theory it relies upon, together with images and formulas that additionally explain the concepts of the project.<br/><br/>\n",
    "        To conclude, this notebook proves that the Jupyter Notebook allows the users to build multi-dimensional projects with support for many technologies applicable across different scientific domains. Having this in mind, together with the fast growing community and the large number of scientists, universities and researchers using Jupyter technologies, Project Jupyter appears to have a bright future ahead in the world of science and research and might bring radical changes in the way breakthroughs in scientific areas are discovered and validated.\n",
